## About the game

We have chosen to emulate one of the levels Sonic Pinball Party game (Game Boy Advance, 2003). The level selected is called Clawtz.
You can see a gameplay of the original version [here](https://youtu.be/Fh9MWeipSW0?t=1161).

Player controls:

**Show chain and sensors and you can pick and drag the ball around (hold right mouse button).

**CAUTION: The use of debugging option may break the game severely in certain points as it enters in conflict with the way the ball is destroyed.

## How to play

The goal of the game is score as many points as you can before losing three balls. You can score points in the following ways:

* Impacting one of the two top bushes.
* Impacting one of the two bounce triangles.
* Entering the ball through one of the teleport holes.
* Touching 

You can obtain one exta ball once the ball has reached 5 times one of the teleport holes. Progress is shown in form of 5 colorful lights above flippers. Extra score is obtained here too.

Score and balls left can be seen on window title.
