## About the game

We have chosen to emulate one of the levels Sonic Pinball Party game (Game Boy Advance, 2003). The level selected is called Clawtz.
You can see a gameplay of the original version [here](https://youtu.be/Fh9MWeipSW0?t=1161).

## Installation instructions

Download the zip file and unzip it. Open the folder, execute the .exe and enjoy!

_IMPORTANT: do not modify, change or add any folder or file as you might not be able to execute the game._

## Controls

Player controls:
- RIGHT FLIPPER: Right arrow key
- LEFT FLIPPER: Right left key
- LAUNCH BALL: Up arrow key (hold to charge plunger)

General/developer controls:
- EXIT GAME: ESC key or click close button in window
- DEBUG MODE**: F1 key
- CREATE BALL: 1 key

**Show chain and sensors and you can pick and drag the ball around (hold right mouse button).

**CAUTION: The use of debugging option may break the game severely in certain points as it enters in conflict with the way the ball is destroyed.

## How to play

The goal of the game is score as many points as you can before losing three balls. You can score points in the following ways:

* Impacting one of the two top bushes.
* Impacting one of the two bounce triangles.
* Entering the ball through one of the teleport holes.
* Touching one of the four light in both sides of the flippers (activating all of them gives extra score).
* Once the ball has passed through the central piece three times a boss appears. If killed score is obtained.

You can obtain one exta ball once the ball has reached 5 times one of the teleport holes. Progress is shown in form of 5 colorful lights above flippers. Extra score is obtained here too.

Score and balls left can be seen on window title.
